# Habib Bidirectional Hashmap

This is a bidirectional hashmap implementation in pure Rust.
Values are mapped one-to-one, meaning that each key is associated with exactly one value and vice versa.
The hashing algorithm is exchangeable, mirroring how the standard library's `HashMap` works.
The API tries to mirror the standard library's `HashMap` where applicable.

The library is Work In Progress and not yet ready for use.
